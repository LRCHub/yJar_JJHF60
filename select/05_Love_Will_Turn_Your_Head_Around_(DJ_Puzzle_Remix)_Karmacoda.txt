Love will turn your head aroundlwtyha
Turn turn turn...
Turn the lights down low, light a candle
Turn my stereo on
I'm turning circles, here by myself
Dreaming of turning you on
Love
Dreaming of turning you on
Dreaming of turning you
Love will turn your head around
Turn turn turn...
You always give your very best away
And it doesn't matter who can see
You're the only one that counts for me
Love is holy
When the tension gathers all around
And you feel like something's coming down
Hold your head up, walk your ground
Love is holy, love is holy
Love will turn your head around
Hanging with you, you're a lyrical child
Taking your time on the miracle mile
Loving with you, you're a lyrical child
Taking the time on the miracle mile
What do we want; its the tip of the tongue
Here with you now; its the song that we've sung
Love will turn your head around
Lighting up this place I keep
I can hardly get the sleep I need
I'm wondering if I can turn the eye in the storm
Love
Ritualized; its all I can be
Underneath a shrouding of me I wonder
If I, if I can turn, turn the eye
Long, it was so long
Love will turn your head around
Long, it was so long
And I will lay here
Ooh child
Don't you stay, and I will lay here
Ooh
To calm your storms
Turn your head around
Stay here
I will play here
Turning in circles
The eye of the storm
Ooh stay
Don't you take it all
Turning in circles
Ooh child
Of your calm
Inheriting your world's what I seek
Turn your, turn your head around
Longing to the be the eye of your calm
Ooh ooh love
Dreaming of turning you on
Turn your, turn your head around
Longing to be the eye of your calm
Dreaming of turning you on
Ooh stay
Dreaming of turning you
Eye of calm
Love will turn your head around
Ooh calm
The eye of calm
