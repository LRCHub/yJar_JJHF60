Where is the puzzle?
That bothered me so
How do I let my family know
O I'm disappearing
Into the wind

I knew everything once
And now I know it all again
Bliss comes with conclusion
Comes with an end

Hear our voices
Pass it on
Knowledge is born
With a singing dawn
Goodbye and welcome troubled song
My body fades ... your life goes on

I knew everything once
And now I know it all again
Bliss comes with conclusion
Comes with an end

And I want only you
And I trust only you
And I want only to
Sing you
