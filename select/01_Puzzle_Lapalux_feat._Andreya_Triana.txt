Pieces of a broken puzzle
They don't fit no more
Not like before

Visions of the past wrought in two
Closing all the doors
Falling through the floor

I don't want this
I don't want this
I don't need this

And it's all broken in two
These visions of you
Of you, and I'm broken in two

And it's all broken in two
These visions of you
Of you, and I'm broken in two
